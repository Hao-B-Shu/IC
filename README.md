# IC

This is Matlab codes for the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13052

The codes in MPICM_Rank are to discriminate whether the constructed MPICM is IC, where r>=5 and can be changed.

The codes in MPICM_4 are to calculate the volume related to the MPICM for n=4 when comparing MPICM to others over one of the previous criteria employed in the paper.

The codes in MPICM_2r are to calculate the volume related to the MPICM for n=2r when comparing MPICM to others over one of the previous criteria employed in the paper, where r>=5 and can be changed.

The codes in MUB_4 are to calculate the volume related to a MUB over one of the previous criteria employed in the paper.

The codes in Random_Bases are to randomly select a set of n+1 orthonormal bases in C^n and calculate the volume related to it over one of the previous criteria employed in the paper.
